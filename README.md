# Andre Nicholas Jr Engine (ANJE)
A JS Fork Engine Focused on Performance and Fun

## Purpose
Andre Nicholas Jr Engine is a fork of Jordan Santiago’s JS Engine, built to:

- Remove Botplay Lag
- Lock 60 FPS in place
- Showcase cool mods like Dave and Bambi or shader-heavy songs
- Compete with H-Slice and JS Engine for better performance

_This engine wasn’t originally made just for Dave and Bambi, but you can use it for that if you want!_

### What I Allow

- Fork the engine freely, Jordan allows forks like this!
- Edit the source code however you like—just don’t complain to me if you break it during compile.
- Use it for fun projects, mods, and shader experiments.

### What I Don’t Allow
- Don’t break the engine on purpose.
- If you fork it, take care of it like it’s your own project.

## Note Limit Warning
ANJE can’t handle 30k+ notes on screen without lag (yet).
We’re working on performance, but be reasonable.

## Compilation Info
### How to Compile
I use Main.yml GitHub Workflow to compile.
Heads up:

It may take 2–3 hours to build everything. Depends on your system.

_Windows builds are recommended!_

## System Requirements
_At least 15–16 GB of RAM_

<!--If you’re insane? Try 256 GB of RAM for NO LAG (not rlly necessary lmao)-->

NASA PC? Won’t lag at all.

## Crazy Key Support
If you’re into keycount madness:

- 18 keys? No problem
- 26 keys? Sure
- 105 keys? Possible
- 500 keys? If I’m crazy enough, I’ll do it.

## Credits

- _**ChatGPT**_ (for helping me fix bugs and making dev life easier)

# Final Notes
This engine is supposed to be a fork to beat H-Slice with less lag.

If anything breaks, I’ll fix it!

## Contact & Updates
If you need 18+ key support, shaders help, or want to collab, hit me up.

I’m done now, so bye!
