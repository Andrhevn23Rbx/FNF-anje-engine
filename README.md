Andre Nicholas Jr Engine (ANJE)
A JS Fork Engine Focused on Performance and Fun

Purpose
Andre Nicholas Jr Engine is a fork of Jordan Santiago’s JS Engine, built to:

Remove Botplay Lag

Lock 60 FPS in place

Showcase cool mods like Dave and Bambi or shader-heavy songs

Compete with H-Slice and JS Engine for better performance

This engine wasn’t originally made just for Dave and Bambi, but you can use it for that if you want!

What I Allow
Fork the engine freely, Jordan allows forks like this!

Edit the source code however you like—just don’t complain to me if you break it during compile.

Use it for fun projects, mods, and shader experiments.

What I Don’t Allow
Don’t break the engine on purpose.
If you fork it, take care of it like it’s your own project.

Note Limit Warning
ANJE can’t handle 30k+ notes on screen without lag (yet).
We’re working on performance, but be reasonable.

Compilation Info
How to Compile
I use Main.yml GitHub Workflow to compile.
Heads up:

It may take 2–3 hours to build everything

It can lag your whole house WiFi, LOL

Windows Build recommended

System Requirements
At least 15–16 GB of RAM

If you’re insane? Try 256 GB of RAM for NO LAG

NASA PC? Won’t lag at all. LMAO

Crazy Key Support
If you’re into keycount madness:

18 keys? No problem

26 keys? Sure

105 keys? Possible

500 keys? If I’m crazy enough, I’ll do it.

Final Notes
This engine is supposed to be a fork to beat H-Slice with less lag.

If anything breaks, I’ll fix it!

Contact & Updates
If you need 18+ key support, shaders help, or want to collab, hit me up.

I’m done now, so bye!
